# CrossyRoadsDemo Exploring SceneKit again.
An application using SceneKit, exploring 3D Game Scenes, models, animation, Physics and nodes.
1/ Boiler plate code to create the View and Scene. The GameViewController was stripped out and only the viewDidLoad() function was left.
two functions were added, setupView() and setupScene() all scene assets were deleted. The hide Status bar and requires full screen were 
ticked and the Plist for the View-Controller status bar was set to NO.
2/ Another exploration into primitives, using physics, gravity and forces.
